## Design
***
### Color Scheme
The main colors used throughout the blog were black, white, and grey. This creates a clean and easy-to-navigate look for the blog. The use of black for the navbar helps to create a cohesive and unified look, while the use of white for the text and buttons makes it easy for readers to find what they need. The use of grey adds a sense of sophistication and professionalism to the design.

### Typography
The font used is called 'Playfair Display'
> Playfair is a transitional font from the 18th century that features high-contrast, delicate hairlines. It was influenced by the change from broad nib quills to pointed steel pens and advances in printing technology.

## Wireframes
***
The first sketched wireframes of the blog can be seen below. The final look of the blog ended up being very close to these mockups.

Under the wireframing process I gathered ideas for the design and features from the music reviews website called [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/).
